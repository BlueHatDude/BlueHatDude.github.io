    <p>
      This was my first non-trivial project in C. The project has gone through three iterations so far.
      M-Calculator Version 1 was barely functional (and has been removed from Github). The program simply 
      evaluated operators from left to right, ignoring order of operators. M-Calculator Version 2 was better,
      taking into account order of operations. But the way the equation was represented was prone to error, and
      there was no error checking on the inputs. M-Calculator Version 3 was built after I learned more about data 
      structures, and I realized that it would be best to represent the tokens using a tree.
      <strong>*M-Calculator Version 3 is still under development!</strong>
