        I am a software developer who is mainly interested in robotics and machine learning.
        I have experience in C, C++, Java, Python, and Rust. I enjoy working on projects just
        for the sake of understanding how something works internally.

      <h2>C Projects</h2>
      <div>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/BlueHatDude/m-calc_ver.3" target="_blank">
          M-Calculator
        </a></h3>
        <p>
          This was my first non-trivial project in C. The project has gone through three iterations so far.
          M-Calculator Version 1 was barely functional (and has been removed from Github). The program simply 
          evaluated operators from left to right, ignoring order of operators. M-Calculator Version 2 was better,
          taking into account order of operations. But the way the equation was represented was prone to error, and
          there was no error checking on the inputs. M-Calculator Version 3 was built after I learned more about data 
          structures, and I realized that it would be best to represent the tokens using a tree.
          <strong>*M-Calculator Version 3 is still under development!</strong>
